### 1. Publishing process, protocols, and tools

Deploying—or pushing new code to a server—is an integral part of a developer’s daily workflow. Knowing the relationship between your computer (including your local development environment) and the Internet, as well as how to communicate between the two, is essential for every developer.

[What is a web server? (MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_web_server) 

 - In this article, MDN go over what web servers are, how they work, and
   why they're important.

### Complete the following exercises

#### A. Create your own version of the examples in  [Example Set 3](http://bajcar.dev.fast.sheridanc.on.ca/web10049/gridCards_examples_03.html) in directory `C:\public_html\syst10049\practice`, choosing an appropriate name.
-
	 - [ ] start with minimal HTML5 document
	 - [ ] copy the rendered content (right-hand side) into the body
	 - [ ] try to mark it up without looking at the html code
	 - [ ] if you have to look, document (in comments) why, dig deeper, make notes.
* test the page by running it with Chrome (check that the title and the content display as expected).
* validate your code at [W3C Validation Markup Service](https://validator.w3.org) (remove all warnings and errors);
* re-test and document your observations in the prologue's description;
* explore deeper by looking up references for any unfamiliar elements and attributes; 
* pay close attention to values that can be assigned to the attributes; 
* are the attributes global or element-specific?
* add to your written code, as comments, all corrections and observations.

#### B. Complete the [Media and hyperlink content project](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Media-and-hyperlink-content-project--AkjRC0d9y_F5WqVHWfQnYdcAAQ-4pSmQVksDzUr3RWIbawX2). Additional instructions will be provided in class.
The new link to the media is: [http://bajcar.dev.fast.sheridanc.on.ca/web10049/media/](http://bajcar.dev.fast.sheridanc.on.ca/web10049/media/)

#### C. Explore video example: [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Video_and_audio_content#Other_%3Cvideo%3E_features](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Video_and_audio_content#Other_%3Cvideo%3E_features)

#### D. ### Complete "Marking Up A Letter"
The  [tutorial Marking Up A Letter on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Marking_up_a_letter) contains lists (will be covered in the next unit) and links,... DO NOT USE any styles! If there is something that cannot be done with pure HTML5, it needs to be documented as comments in the code. Do not use the `address` element for the addressee. Check out the intended usage on w3schools and w3.org.

Create project directory `markup_letter` in directory `C:\public_html\syst10049`. Add and enhance with your own research using primary sources. Test, validate, and practice publishing.

Bring questions to next class and show me your progress.
