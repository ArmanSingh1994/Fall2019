## Instructions
1. Start with a new project called `assignment4` with the following file structure:
The images for this project can be found at [http://bajcar.dev.fast.sheridanc.on.ca/project_assets/project_cats/](http://bajcar.dev.fast.sheridanc.on.ca/project_assets/project_cats/)

│   │   ├── images/
│   │   │   ├── cat1.gif

```
2. Create `index.html` with minimal HTML5 document. The target rendered display will be:

3. Identify and create structural elements.

	- The header contains a top level heading.
	- The footer contains contact information.
	- The navigation, main, and aside are wrapped in a generic division that is classified as `flex-container`
	- The navigation contains anchors; each anchor is wrapped in a `span` that will be classified later; sufficient to start with three anchors (Home, Tic CAT Toe,  CAT Paper Scissors)
	- The six cat images are included at the beginning (or end) of the main container.
	- The aside is a simple unordered list.

 4. The `game_rpsls.html` has the same structure, with the exception of the main content:
