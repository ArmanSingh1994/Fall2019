3. Identify and create structural elements.

	- The header contains a top level heading.
	- The footer contains contact information.
	- The navigation, main, and aside are wrapped in a generic division that is classified as `flex-container`
	- The navigation contains anchors; each anchor is wrapped in a `span` that will be classified later; sufficient to start with three anchors (Home, Tic CAT Toe,  CAT Paper Scissors)
	- The six cat images are included at the beginning (or end) of the main container.
	- The aside is a simple unordered list.
